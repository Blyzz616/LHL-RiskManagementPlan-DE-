## Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Methodology:

The objective of this document is to establish a methodology for evaluating and addressing information risks within DE, aligning with ISO/IEC 27001 standards. Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment protocols are to be implemented across the entirety of DE's Information Security Management System (ISMS), covering all assets utilized within the organization or potentially impacting information security within the ISMS framework.

### Risk Assessment:

#### The Process:
- The risk assessment process will involve
  - Gathering information about DE's operations, infrastructure, and external environment.
  - Identifying assets, vulnerabilities, and threats.
  - Analyzing the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks.
  - Prioritizing risks based on their significance to DE's operations and objectives.
  - Individuals involved
    - IT - to understand the technicality
    - Finance - to understand the costs involved
    - Management - to make descisions based on infomration from the other two.

#### Assets, Vulnerabilities, and Threats
- Main threats:  
  **Cybersecurity Attacks**  
     Such as data breaches or ransomware attacks targeting customer data or internal systems.  
  **Supply Chain Disruptions**  
     Including disruptions in the delivery of essential components or services.  
  **Competition**  
     From other providers in the market, potentially leading to loss of market share or revenue.  
- Challenges in managing these threats:
  - Limited resources for implementing robust cybersecurity measures.
  - Complexity of supply chain networks, making it difficult to identify and mitigate potential disruptions.
  - Fast-moving market requiring continuous adaptation and innovation.

#### Determining the Risk Owners

Individuals or groups involved  
  1. **IT Security Team** - Owner: Information System Owner  
     Due to their expertise in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
  2. **Supply Chain Management Team** Owner: System Manager  
     As supply chain disruptions can have significant impacts on DE's operations.
  3. **Executive Management** Owner: Chief Executive Officer  
     To provide strategic direction and make decisions regarding risk management priorities.

#### Impact and Likelihood:
| Threat                 | Impact (C/I/A) | Likelihood |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| CYbersecurity Attacks  | High (9)              | Moderate (3)         |
| Supply Chain Disruptions | High (8)             | Moderate (3)         |
| Competitive Pressure   | Moderate (5)          | High (5)            |

#### Risk Acceptance Criteria:
- The most likely/highest risk item, such as Supply Chain Disruptions, may severely impact DE's operations, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.
- Some items in the may be "accepted" based on DE's risk tolerance and available resources. For instance, while "Competitive Pressure" is a significant risk, it must be accepted as a normal part of doing business in a competitive environment.

### Risk Treatment:

#### Summary of Identified Threats and Recommended Mitigations:
1. **Cybersecurity Attacks**  
   - **Mitigations**  
     Implement robust cybersecurity measures, including regular security audits, employee training on cybersecurity best practices, and deploying advanced threat detection systems.
   - **Priority**  
     High, as a data breach or cyberattack could severely impact DE's reputation and financial stability.
2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**  
   - **Mitigation**  
     Develop contingency plans, diversify suppliers, and establish clear communication channels with key partners to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions.
   - **Priority**  
     High, as disruptions in the supply chain could lead to delays in product delivery and customer dissatisfaction.
3. **MArket Competition**  
   - **Mitigations**  
     Conduct regular market analysis, focus on innovation and customer-centric strategies.
   - **Priority**  
     Medium, as while competitive pressure is a constant in the market, effective strategies and R&D can help DE maintain its competitive edge and mitigate its impact.

#### Prioritization and Recommended Responses:
- The prioritization of threats is based on their potential impact on DE's operations and reputation, as well as the likelihood of occurrence.
- Recommended responses are aligned with industry-standard frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 31000, ensuring comprehensive risk mitigation strategies.
