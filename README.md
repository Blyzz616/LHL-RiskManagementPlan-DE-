## Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Methodology:

Purpose, scope, and users

### Risk Assessment:

#### The Process:
- The risk assessment process will involve
  - Gathering information about DE's operations, infrastructure, and external environment.
  - Identifying assets, vulnerabilities, and threats.
  - Analyzing the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks.
  - Prioritizing risks based on their significance to DE's operations and objectives.
  - Individuals involved
    - IT - to understand the technicality
    - Finance - to understand the costs involved
    - Management - to make descisions based on infomration from the other two.

#### Assets, Vulnerabilities, and Threats
- Main threats:
  1. **Cybersecurity Attacks**
     Such as data breaches or ransomware attacks targeting customer data or internal systems.
  2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**
     Including disruptions in the delivery of essential components or services.
  3. **Competition**
     From other providers in the market, potentially leading to loss of market share or revenue.
- Challenges in managing these threats:
  - Limited resources for implementing robust cybersecurity measures.
  - Complexity of supply chain networks, making it difficult to identify and mitigate potential disruptions.
  - Fast-moving market requiring continuous adaptation and innovation.

#### Determining the Risk Owners

Individuals or groups involved  
  1. **IT Security Team** - Owner: Information System Owner  
     Due to their expertise in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
  2. **Supply Chain Management Team** Owner: System Manager  
     As supply chain disruptions can have significant impacts on DE's operations.
  3. **Executive Management** Owner: Chief Executive Officer  
     To provide strategic direction and make decisions regarding risk management priorities.

#### Impact and Likelihood:
| Threat                 | Impact (C/I/A) | Likelihood |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Cybersecurity Attacks  | High              | Moderate         |
| Supply Chain Disruptions | High             | Moderate          |
| Competitive Pressure   | Moderate          | High             |

#### Risk Acceptance Criteria:
- The most likely/highest risk item, such as Supply Chain Disruptions, may severely impact DE's operations, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.
- Some items in the table may be "accepted" based on DE's risk tolerance and available resources. For instance, while Competitive Pressure is a significant risk, it must be accepted as a normal part of doing business in a competitive environment.

### Risk Treatment:

#### Summary of Identified Threats and Recommended Mitigations:
1. **Cybersecurity Attacks**  
   - **Mitigations**  
     Implement robust cybersecurity measures, including regular security audits, employee training on cybersecurity best practices, and deploying advanced threat detection systems.
   - **Priority**  
     High, as a data breach or cyberattack could severely impact DE's reputation and financial stability.
2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**  
   - **Mitigations**  
     Develop contingency plans, diversify suppliers, and establish clear communication channels with key partners to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions.
   - **Priority**  
     High, as disruptions in the supply chain could lead to delays in product delivery and customer dissatisfaction.
3. **MArket Competition**  
   - **Mitigations**  
     Conduct regular market analysis, focus on innovation and customer-centric strategies.
   - **Priority**  
     Medium, as while competitive pressure is a constant in the market, effective strategies and R&D can help DE maintain its competitive edge and mitigate its impact.

#### Prioritization and Recommended Responses:
- The prioritization of threats is based on their potential impact on DE's operations and reputation, as well as the likelihood of occurrence.
- Recommended responses are aligned with industry-standard frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 31000, ensuring comprehensive risk mitigation strategies.
